# Examples

This is a location for examples on how to use individual pieces of code within this library, how to run the pipeline, and how to make changes to the code.

# Using core libraries directly

If you want to use any of the core libraries without the pipeline wrapper, please consult [using core libraries](using_core_libraries_directly/)

## To create a new project workflow

If you want to make a new project without writing any new code, please consult [create new project](create_new_project/)

## Adding new code

If you want to add new code to the code hub, either for direct access or for pipeline usage, please consilt [add new code](add_new_code/)

## Adding arguments to pipeline_manager.py

If you need to add a keyword to the pipeline_manager to find your new code, please consult [add pipeline arguments](add_pipeline_arguments/)

## Adding preprocessing and feature options

If you want to add new preprocessing options or features to extract, please consult [adding preprocessing and features](adding_preprocessing_and_features/)
