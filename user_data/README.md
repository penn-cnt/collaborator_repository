# User Data
This folder is a private directory to store working data. At present, only README.md files will be visible to the web.

## Long term data storage

We highly recommend that projects nearing completion make use of Lief/Borel to store data. More information on how to work with data on these remote systems can be found at:

### Python
> [stream_ssh.py](../scripts/codehub/utils/acquisition/stream_ssh.py)

### Matlab
> Under development
