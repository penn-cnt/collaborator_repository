# Sample User Directory

## Naming conventions

This is an example user folder. Personal project work takes place in folders saved at the same level as the central `codehub' folder.

We require that the naming of the folder follow the following design pattern:

> {device name}\_{project name}\_{optional subdirectory}


We require this naming structure in order to join different projects within the CNT data ecosystem. Multiple users can work within a single repository, either within the same directory or within their own optional subdirectories.

## Updating the codehub libraries

Any changes to scripts within the [modules](../codehub/modules) subdiretory can be submitted to the main lab repository as its own branch, at which point a pull request will be reviewed before changes are accepted or rejected.
